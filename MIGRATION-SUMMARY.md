## 📊 What Changed

### Before (Old Stack):
- **Framework:** Astro (static site generator)
- **Interactivity:** Alpine.js (inline directives)
- **Language:** JavaScript
- **State Management:** None (localStorage hacks)
- **Issues:** Framework conflicts, no type safety, hard to debug

### After (New Stack):
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (React-based full-stack)
- **Interactivity:** React components
- **Language:** TypeScript (100% type-safe)
- **State Management:** Zustand with persistence
- **Benefits:** Single paradigm, type safety, better DX
